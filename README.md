## Introduction

The objective of this project is to apply advanced time series forecasting techniques to predict store sales. By utilizing a historical dataset provided by Kaggle, we aim to develop models that accurately forecast future sales, providing insights that could be valuable for inventory management and business strategy.

## Methodology

The methodology applied in this work includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns that influence store sales.
3. **Model Development**: Implementing various time series forecasting models, including classical and machine learning-based approaches.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using RMSLE and other relevant metrics.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques such as GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
6. **Prediction and Interpretation**: Making final predictions on the test set and interpreting the results.

## Tools Used

The tools and libraries used in the project include:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Statsmodels

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of time series forecasting techniques in predicting store sales. Through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model development, and evaluation, we were able to achieve significant predictive performance, which could be applied in real-world scenarios for better business decision-making.
